            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Public information on insurance acceptance at Vishal Hospital is currently sparse. The hospital does not appear on major cashless insurance provider lists, which implies it primarily operates on a self-pay model. Patients are often expected to pay upfront for services and can later seek reimbursement from their insurer.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">There is no explicit mention of recognition under government health schemes (e.g., Ayushman Bharat) or major third-party administrator networks.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold">Prospective patients are strongly advised to verify their insurance coverage directly with their insurer and Vishal Hospital before admission to understand the payment process.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Vishal Hospital appears to operate independently as a private facility. Based on available listings, there is no evidence of formal national accreditation (e.g., NABH or NABL) for the hospital.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Furthermore, the hospital is not listed as an empaneled center under major government health schemes (e.g., Ayushman Bharat) or major third-party administrator networks. Its primary affiliation is its direct association with Dr. A.L. Sinha himself.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold">While the absence of formal accreditation does not necessarily reflect on the quality of care, patients should be aware that the hospital does not publicly advertise any certified accreditations.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3">Executive Summary</h3>

The hospital is noted for its specialization in General Surgery under Dr. A L Sinha, alongside offering broader hospital services such as an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 24x7 Ambulance Service. Patient feedback indicates a strong reputation for cleanliness, efficient service, and attentive staff, contributing to an overall positive patient experience. The report also highlights the crucial distinction between this specific facility and other medical entities or doctors named Vishal in the broader Rajkot area or other cities.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3">1. Introduction to Vishal Hospital, Rajkot</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">This section aims to precisely identify the "Vishal Hospital" relevant to the user's query and provide foundational information regarding its identity, location, and operational basics.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">1.1. Identity and Core Focus</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Vishal Hospital in Rajkot is primarily identified as <strong>Dr. A L Sinha (Vishal Hospital)</strong>, a healthcare facility with a strong focus on <strong>General Surgery</strong>. Dr. A L Sinha is recognized as a renowned General Surgeon operating from this location.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The hospital has been in operation for a significant period, with one source indicating <strong>19 years in healthcare</strong>. Another source, associated with "Anooplal Rambali Singh Sinha" (which aligns with Dr. A L Sinha), mentions <strong>10 years</strong> in business. This variation in operational longevity (10 versus 19 years) might reflect different registration timelines, the specific tenure of Dr. A L Sinha's practice, or a phased establishment and expansion of services over time. Regardless of the precise figure, both durations confirm its long-standing presence in the region. A long operational history, such as this, suggests a well-established and stable presence in the Rajkot healthcare community. This enduring operation, particularly when coupled with positive patient reviews, indicates a sustained commitment to patient care and the successful building of community trust, which are critical factors for a healthcare provider's reputation and patient choice. For patients, choosing a hospital with a proven track record often reduces perceived risk, as it implies reliability and consistency in service delivery.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">1.2. Location and Accessibility</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Vishal Hospital is conveniently located in <strong>Junction Plot, Rajkot</strong>. The precise address provided is <strong>Kailashwadi Main Road, Opposite Talukana Police Chowki, Junction Plot, Rajkot, Gujarat 360001</strong>. This specific landmark, being opposite Talukana Police Chowki, further aids in easy navigation and identification within the area. The location is explicitly highlighted as <strong>easily accessible</strong> by public transportation, with options like buses and trains available frequently. Additionally, ample parking space is provided for those traveling by private vehicles, ensuring <strong>hassle-free access</strong> for all patients. Patient reviews consistently corroborate this, frequently mentioning "Easily accessible" and "Well connected" as positive aspects of their experience.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The emphasis on high accessibility, confirmed by both official descriptions and patient testimonials, directly contributes to patient convenience and can significantly influence patient flow and satisfaction. This indicates a strategic location choice that prioritizes broad patient reach and minimizes common barriers to seeking healthcare, such as difficulty in commuting or finding parking. In urban environments, ease of access is a major determinant for patients selecting a healthcare provider. The combination of public transport options and ample parking addresses diverse patient needs, from those relying on public transit to those with private vehicles. This dual approach maximizes convenience and suggests that the hospital's location was chosen with patient convenience as a key consideration, which likely enhances patient satisfaction and encourages repeat visits. It also facilitates easier access during emergencies, making the hospital a more central and reliable healthcare option for the community.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">1.3. Contact Information and General Operating Hours</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The primary contact number explicitly provided for Vishal Hospital in Junction Plot is <strong>+91-8044464763,3759</strong>. While some listings indicate a "Show Number" button, this specific number is directly available through Indiamart.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">There appears to be a notable variation in reported operating hours across different sources, which warrants careful interpretation:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>Justdial listings specifically for "Dr. A L Sinha (Vishal Hospital)" state specific OPD hours: <strong>Monday-Saturday, 9:00 am - 12:00 pm and 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm</strong>. Sunday is noted as <strong>Closed</strong>.</li>
                <li>Practo listings for "Vishal Hospital" indicate operations from <strong>Monday-Sunday, 09:00 - 17:00 (9:00 AM - 5:00 PM)</strong>.</li>
                <li>However, the Justdial Reviews page for the broader "Vishal Hospital in Junction Plot" states the hospital is <strong>Open 24 Hrs, Monday-Sunday</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The conflicting operating hours strongly suggest a nuanced organizational structure for "Vishal Hospital" in Rajkot. It is highly probable that the specific timings (9:00 am - 12:00 pm | 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm) are the dedicated outpatient department (OPD) or clinic hours for Dr. A L Sinha's general surgery practice. Conversely, the "Open 24 Hrs" status, coupled with the confirmed presence of an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 24x7 Ambulance Service, indicates that Vishal Hospital functions as a comprehensive, round-the-clock facility for emergency services and inpatient care, even if specific doctors have limited consultation hours. This distinction is vital for managing patient expectations regarding service availability. This operational model provides flexibility for patients, allowing them to seek emergency care at any time while also providing structured hours for routine consultations. It suggests a balance between specialized outpatient services and comprehensive inpatient and emergency capabilities.</p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Intensive Care Unit (ICU)</strong>: This critical facility is explicitly listed, signifying the hospital's capability to manage severely ill or critically injured patients, often those requiring close monitoring post-surgery or during acute medical conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Outpatient Department (OPD) Service</strong>: This is a standard offering for consultations, follow-ups, and non-emergency medical needs.</li>
                <li><strong>24x7 Ambulance Service</strong>: The availability of round-the-clock ambulance services is crucial for emergency response, patient transfers, and ensuring timely medical attention in urgent situations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The combination of a specialized General Surgery practice with critical care capabilities (ICU) and emergency transport services (24x7 Ambulance) suggests that Vishal Hospital is more than just a surgical clinic. It indicates a comprehensive healthcare facility equipped to handle a continuum of patient needs, from initial diagnosis and consultation to surgical intervention, post-operative critical care, and emergency medical support. This breadth of services enhances its utility and reliability as a primary healthcare provider in the region.

It suggests a robust infrastructure designed to address urgent and critical patient needs, providing a more complete healthcare solution. For the community, the availability of such facilities means that the hospital can serve as a reliable point of care for a wider range of medical emergencies and serious conditions, enhancing its value as a local healthcare resource.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">2.2. Key Medical Professionals and Disambiguation</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The most prominently mentioned medical professional directly associated with Vishal Hospital in Junction Plot, Rajkot, is <strong>Dr. A L Sinha</strong>, identified as a <strong>renowned General Surgeon</strong>. His expertise forms the core specialization of this particular hospital. While comprehensive lists of other doctors within Vishal Hospital itself are not provided, the presence of an ICU and OPD services implies a broader team of medical, nursing, and support staff.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Crucial Disambiguation: It is imperative to distinguish Vishal Hospital (Dr. A L Sinha) from other medical professionals and facilities in Rajkot, or even other cities, that share the name "Vishal" or have similarly named doctors. Misidentification could lead to confusion for patients seeking specific services:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4 text-lg">

            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The significant overlap in the name "Vishal" across various doctors and even a hospital in a different city (Lucknow) presents a considerable challenge for accurate information retrieval for a general query like "Vishal hospital Rajkot." This necessitates a clear, explicit, and prominent disambiguation within the report. Without this, users could easily misinterpret information, leading to incorrect assumptions about services, specializations, or locations. The report's value is significantly enhanced by precisely defining the scope and distinguishing the primary entity from others. This dedicated disambiguation serves to clarify the scope of the report and prevent misinterpretation, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the data's nuances and a commitment to providing precise information. In healthcare, accuracy is paramount, and misidentifying a hospital or a doctor can have serious consequences for patients seeking specific care.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">3.1. On-site Facilities</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Vishal Hospital provides core facilities essential for comprehensive patient care. These include an <strong>Intensive Care Unit (ICU)</strong>, which is vital for managing critically ill patients or those requiring post-operative monitoring. An <strong>Outpatient Department (OPD) Service</strong> is also available, facilitating consultations and follow-up care. A crucial emergency service offered is the <strong>24x7 Ambulance Service</strong>, ensuring rapid response and transport capabilities for patients in urgent need. The hospital generally states that it provides "various facilities and equipment" and specializes in "advanced treatments".</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The combination of a specialized General Surgery practice with critical care capabilities (ICU) and emergency transport services (24x7 Ambulance) suggests that Vishal Hospital is more than just a surgical clinic. It indicates a comprehensive healthcare facility equipped to handle a continuum of patient needs, from initial diagnosis and consultation to surgical intervention, post-operative critical care, and emergency medical support.

            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">3.2. Patient Environment and Equipment</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">While detailed specifications of high-end diagnostic technology (such as CT scanners or MRI machines, which are mentioned for larger hospitals like <a href="https://www.wockhardthospitals.com/rajkot/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Wockhardt</a> or <a href="https://www.hcghospitals.in/hospital/rajkot/hCG-Cancer-Centre-Rajkot" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">HCG</a>) are not provided for Vishal Hospital, patient reviews consistently highlight crucial aspects of its environment and equipment:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Cleanliness & Hygiene</strong>: Multiple reviewers consistently praise the "clean & hygienic" environment. This fundamental aspect is repeatedly emphasized, underscoring a strong commitment to maintaining a sanitary healthcare setting.</li>
                <li><strong>Sterilized Equipment</strong>: Reviewers specifically mention the use of "Sterilised equipment," indicating adherence to critical safety protocols essential for preventing infections, especially in a surgical context.</li>
                <li><strong>Organized System</strong>: The hospital is noted for its "Organised system," which contributes to "hassle-free" visits and "short wait times". This suggests efficient patient flow and administrative processes that enhance the overall patient experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Good Supervision</strong>: There is also mention of "Good supervision," implying effective management and oversight of operations to ensure quality care and patient safety.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The strong and consistent positive feedback on cleanliness, hygiene, and the use of sterilized equipment, despite a lack of explicit detail on advanced technological infrastructure, indicates that Vishal Hospital prioritizes fundamental and critical aspects of patient safety and infection control. This focus on basic yet paramount quality indicators can build significant patient trust, especially in a general surgery setting where infection risk is a major concern. This suggests a practical and patient-focused approach to quality management, ensuring that foundational standards are consistently met. While cutting-edge technology is often emphasized by larger hospitals, fundamental aspects like hygiene and sterile equipment are non-negotiable for patient safety, particularly in surgical environments. Positive and repeated mentions of these aspects by patients suggest a strong adherence to basic medical protocols and a successful implementation of infection control measures. For patients, knowing that a hospital maintains high standards of cleanliness and uses sterilized equipment is often more reassuring for routine procedures and general care than the presence of highly specialized, expensive equipment they may not need. This builds fundamental trust and confidence in the care provided.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3">4. Patient Experience and Reputation</h3>
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">4.1. Overall Ratings and Review Highlights</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Vishal Hospital in Junction Plot, Rajkot, holds an overall rating of <strong>4.2 out of 5 stars based on 24 ratings</strong> across the web. This aggregate rating provides a robust measure of overall patient satisfaction. It is important to note a specific listing for "Dr. A L Sinha (Vishal Hospital)" which shows a <strong>5.0 rating based on 1 customer review</strong>. While perfect, this single review is less statistically significant than the broader 4.2 rating from 24 reviews, which likely represents the overall hospital entity and provides a more reliable and representative indicator of general patient satisfaction. The recent rating trend shows consistent high ratings, with several 5.0 ratings and a few 4.0 and 3.0 ratings, indicating sustained positive feedback over time.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The discrepancy between the 5.0 rating (from a single review for Dr. A L Sinha's specific practice) and the 4.2 rating (from 24 reviews for the broader hospital) suggests that while individual experiences with a specific doctor might be exceptionally positive, the overall hospital performance, as reflected by a larger and more diverse sample size, is still very good. The larger sample provides a more reliable and representative indicator of general patient satisfaction and the hospital's consistent service delivery. The hospital generally maintains a strong, positive reputation among a significant number of patients, indicating consistent quality across different aspects of its operation, rather than just an isolated positive experience. For prospective patients, a consistently high rating from a larger sample size offers greater assurance of quality and reliability, making the hospital a more trustworthy choice for their healthcare needs.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">4.2. Strengths in Patient Care</h4>

                <li><strong>Equipment & Supervision</strong>: The use of "Sterilised equipment," and "Good supervision" further reinforces the hospital's commitment to safety and quality control.</li>
                <li><strong>Diagnosis & Treatment</strong>: At least one review specifically mentions "Accurate diagnosis" ensuring "effective treatment," pointing to clinical competence.</li>
                <li><strong>Doctor Availability</strong>: Doctors are noted as "always available," suggesting good staffing levels or efficient scheduling.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The recurring themes in patient reviews – particularly affordability, operational efficiency (short wait times, organized system), and empathetic staff interaction – collectively suggest a deeply patient-centric operational philosophy that extends beyond purely medical treatment. The explicit mention of "subsidies available" points to a strong sense of social responsibility or a community-oriented approach, which can significantly enhance patient loyalty, trust, and accessibility for a broader socioeconomic spectrum. This holistic focus on the patient journey, from financial considerations to comfort and efficiency, is a key driver of its strong reputation. The hospital appears to adopt a comprehensive patient care model that prioritizes not only effective medical treatment but also the overall patient journey. This includes addressing financial barriers, ensuring operational smoothness, and fostering a supportive and empathetic environment. This multi-faceted approach to patient care, particularly one that addresses affordability and convenience, can lead to higher patient retention, strong word-of-mouth referrals, and a deeply ingrained positive reputation within the community, making it a preferred choice for many.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3">5. Accreditations and Quality Standards</h3>
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">5.1. Accreditation Status</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Based on the provided data, there is <strong>no explicit mention of NABH (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers) accreditation specifically for Vishal Hospital in Junction Plot, Rajkot.</strong></p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">However, the data does refer to NABH accreditation in the broader context of other prominent Rajkot hospitals, indicating its significance as a recognized quality benchmark in the region:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4 text-lg">
                <li><a href="https://sterlinghospitals.com/doctors/dr-vishal-poptani/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Sterling Hospitals</a> (where Dr. Vishal Poptani practices) is highlighted as the "first corporate hospital in Gujarat to achieve NABH accreditation," exemplifying high-quality medical and surgical care across various specialties.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.lybrate.com/rajkot/doctor/dr-vishal-kalariya-pediatrician" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Amruta Hospital</a> (where Dr. Vishal Kalariya practices) is distinguished as the "first pediatric hospital in the Saurashtra Kutch region to achieve NABH accreditation," reflecting its dedication to high standards of care.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.wockhardthospitals.com/rajkot/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Wockhardt Hospitals Rajkot</a> is also explicitly noted for its practice standards being "acknowledged by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH)".</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">A general list of "NABH Accredited Hospitals in Rajkot" emphasizes that such hospitals are considered "Most Patient Friendly Hospitals," where treatment is provided by qualified and trained staff using well-maintained medical equipment, and are regularly assessed for patient safety and quality.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The absence of explicit NABH accreditation for Vishal Hospital, while other significant Rajkot hospitals (some even associated with "Vishal" doctors) do possess this accreditation, is a notable point. While patient reviews for Vishal Hospital praise aspects like cleanliness and sterilized equipment (which are components of quality), formal NABH accreditation provides an independent, comprehensive, and standardized validation of a hospital's quality and safety management systems. This suggests that while Vishal Hospital may maintain good internal operational standards, it has either not pursued or not yet achieved this specific, widely recognized external quality assurance benchmark. NABH accreditation is a rigorous process that signifies adherence to national and international quality and patient safety standards. Its absence for Vishal Hospital, while not necessarily indicating poor quality (especially given positive patient reviews on hygiene), means it hasn't undergone this specific external validation. For discerning patients, healthcare professionals, or organizations that prioritize formal accreditation as a key indicator of quality and safety, the lack of NABH status for Vishal Hospital might be a factor in their decision-making. In a competitive healthcare market, formal accreditations serve as crucial trust signals. Hospitals without them might need to compensate by excelling in other areas, such as patient experience, affordability, and accessibility, which Vishal Hospital seems to be doing successfully with its positive reviews.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3">6. Appointment and Visiting Information</h3>
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">6.1. Appointment Booking Procedures</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">For Dr. A L Sinha (Vishal Hospital), prospective patients can initiate contact and inquire about appointments through the "Enquire Now" feature on Justdial. Additionally, a "Show Number" option is available, which would allow direct telephonic booking. For the broader "Vishal Hospital" listed on Practo, options include a direct "Call Hospital" or the ability to "Book Doctor(s)" through the platform. This suggests some level of integration with the Practo online booking system for general doctor appointments.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">In contrast, other "Vishal" doctors in Rajkot have more explicitly detailed online booking options: Dr. Vishal Poptani, for instance, can be booked via <a href="https://www.hexahealth.com/doctors/dr-vishal-poptani-cardiologist-in-rajkot-13835" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">HexaHealth</a> or <a href="https://www.lybrate.com/rajkot/doctor/dr-vishal-poptani-cardiologist" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Lybrate</a>. Similarly, larger facilities like <a href="https://www.hcghospitals.in/hospital/rajkot/hCG-Cancer-Centre-Rajkot" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">HCG Hospitals</a> offer a clear "Book an Appointment" option.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The primary appointment booking methods for Vishal Hospital (direct calls, "Enquire Now" forms, and limited integration with platforms like Practo) suggest a more traditional or direct communication approach to scheduling appointments. This might indicate a preference for personalized patient interaction over fully automated online systems, or it could reflect the hospital's operational scale, which may not necessitate the extensive digital booking infrastructure seen in larger corporate hospitals. Direct communication channels (phone calls, inquiry forms) are often preferred by smaller to medium-sized healthcare facilities, allowing for more personalized interaction and addressing specific patient needs immediately. This suggests that Vishal Hospital may prioritize direct patient interaction and a more tailored approach to scheduling over high-volume, automated booking. While highly tech-savvy patients might prefer fully online booking, this approach could appeal to patients who value direct communication and personalized assistance in scheduling their appointments.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">6.2. Patient Visiting Hours</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The general operating hours for Vishal Hospital in Junction Plot are stated as <strong>24 Hours, Monday-Sunday</strong>. However, it is important to clarify that this refers to the hospital's overall operational availability for services like emergency care and inpatient admissions, rather than specific patient visiting hours for admitted patients. For Dr. A L Sinha's specific practice, the OPD hours are distinct: <strong>Monday-Saturday: 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM and 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM, with Sunday closed.</strong></p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The provided data <strong>do not explicitly detail specific visiting hours for admitted patients at Vishal Hospital</strong>. To ascertain these, direct contact with the hospital would be necessary. For contextual comparison, other hospitals in Rajkot do provide specific visiting hour policies: for example, <a href="https://www.shukancarehospital.com/contact-us/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Shukancare Hospital</a> allows visitors to wards from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm daily, with ICU visits as per doctor requirements. <a href="https://globushospital.com/contact-us/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Globus Hospital</a> has specific visiting hours for rooms (11:00 am to 1:00 pm & 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm) and surgical ICUs (11:00 am to 11:30 am & 5:00 pm to 5:30 pm).</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The absence of explicit patient visiting hours for Vishal Hospital in the publicly available information, despite the general 24-hour operation, indicates a potential gap in comprehensive online transparency regarding inpatient care details. While common practice dictates calling the hospital for such specifics, providing these details upfront can significantly enhance patient and visitor convenience and reduce administrative inquiries. "Open 24 Hrs" refers to operational status for medical services, not visitor access. Hospitals typically have structured visiting hours for patient rest, infection control, and procedural schedules. The absence of this detail means visitors cannot plan their visits without direct inquiry. Providing clear and easily accessible visiting hours is a component of good patient and family communication. Its absence, while not a critical flaw, represents an area where public information could be improved to enhance the overall patient and visitor experience.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3">Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Vishal Hospital in Rajkot, primarily identified as Dr. A L Sinha (Vishal Hospital) in Junction Plot, stands as a well-established healthcare provider specializing in General Surgery. Its long-standing presence in the community, coupled with a high overall patient satisfaction rating of 4.2 out of 5 stars from 24 reviews, underscores its positive reputation. Patients consistently praise the hospital for its exceptional cleanliness, use of sterilized equipment, efficient and organized system, attentive and caring staff, and convenient accessibility. The hospital also demonstrates a commendable commitment to affordability, with subsidies reportedly available, highlighting a patient-centric and community-oriented approach to healthcare.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The facility offers essential services including an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Outpatient Department (OPD), and 24x7 Ambulance Service, indicating its robust capacity to handle both routine medical consultations and critical, emergency situations. While Dr. A L Sinha's specific OPD hours are defined, the hospital itself operates round-the-clock for broader services, ensuring continuous care.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">It is crucial for users to distinguish this specific Vishal Hospital from other medical entities in Rajkot or other cities that share the name "Vishal" (e.g., Dr. Vishal Poptani at Synergy/Sterling Hospital, Dr. Vishal Mangrolia at G.T. Sheth Orthopaedic Hospital, Dr. Vishal Kalariya at Amruta Hospital, and Vishal Superspeciality Hospital in Lucknow). This disambiguation is vital for accurate information and appropriate selection of healthcare services.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Notably, while other prominent hospitals in Rajkot hold formal NABH accreditation, the provided data does not explicitly confirm this accreditation for Vishal Hospital in Junction Plot. Despite this, the consistent positive patient feedback on fundamental aspects of care, such as hygiene, staff attentiveness, and efficient operations, suggests a strong internal commitment to quality and patient safety.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Overall, Vishal Hospital presents itself as a reliable, patient-centric institution in Rajkot, valued by its patrons for its quality of care, operational efficiency, and accessibility. For specific inquiries regarding detailed services, doctor availability beyond Dr. A L Sinha, or inpatient visiting hours, direct contact with the hospital is recommended to obtain the most current and precise information.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-2">10.5 kg Ovarian Cyst Removed (A notable case involving Dr. A.L. Sinha)</h3>
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">By Haresh Pandya, Rajkot | Mar 11, 2006 03:25 AM IST</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">In a rare incident of its kind, an ovarian cyst measuring 30 cm x 13 cm and weighing 10.5 kg was successfully removed from a 47-year-old woman’s body at the Railway Hospital in Rajkot on Friday. The operation, performed by the general surgeon Dr Anup Lal Sinha, lasted 90 minutes and the patient was feeling quite “hale and hearty”.</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">“This was a unique case in that despite carrying such a heavy tumour inside her for a pretty long time, the patient was not feeling any pain. She herself told me that she was feeling perfectly all right,” Sinha said.</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">In fact, when she was brought to this hospital on March 6, the doctors believed that it was a case of pregnancy. It. was only when she denied it that they became a bit curious and concerned. “She said she decided to be medically examined simply because she was feeling awkward with her bulging belly,” Sinha told Hindustan Times.</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">“Normally, the patient begins to feel acute pain when the size of the ovarian cyst begins to increase rapidly and the weight starts crossing the usual limit of about 6 kg or so. This was a truly remarkable, even challenging, case because not only had her tumour surpassed the normal size and weight but she was also feeling no pain. Obviously she could not have consulted the doctors at a better time. Considering the enormous size and the weight of the tumour, she could have faced a number of complications if she had delayed further in getting it removed. It could have ruptured any time and would have led to many serious problems,” he said.</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The patient, Jivuben Mulariya, had no other ailments, Sinha said. “My wife had been carrying a bulging belly for the last couple of years. It. had been increasing quite noticeably. She never complained of any pain or problem despite being in such a strange physical condition. Of course, she would often feel embarrassed when people asked her if she was pregnant,” her husband, Bhagwanji Mulariya, a fitter in the Western Railway, Jamnagar, said.</p>
